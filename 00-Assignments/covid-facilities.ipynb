    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Hospitals in various counties throughout the US are reaching full capacity due to a surge in COVID-19 patients. Many hospitals are considering creating temporary facilities to increase their capacity to handle COVID-19 patients.\n",

    "![temporary facility](https://github.com/Gurobi/modeling-examples/blob/master/covid19_facility_location/covid19-trailerFacilty.jpg?raw=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we focus on nine counties in the US. Each county has existing facilities to treat COVID-19 patients, and also has the option of building temporary facilities to increase the overall capacity to handle COVID-19 patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following table defines the coordinates of the centroid and the forecasted demand (i.e. the projected number of COVID-19 patients) of each county. To estimate this demand, we consider the population of nine fictional counties in California, the current number of COVID-19 cases per day in California, the average percentage of COVID-19 cases who require hospitalization, and the average number of days that a COVID-19 patient stays in the hospital.\n",

    "In this example, the goal is to identify which temporary facilities to build in order to be able to accommodate demand for treatment by COVID-19 patients while minimizing the total cost of COVID-19 patients driving to an existing or temporary COVID-19 facility and the total cost of building temporary facilities.\n",

    "* How COVID-19 patients from a county should be allocated to various healthcare facilities in order to ensure that the facilities have the capacity to provide treatment for the patients.\n",
